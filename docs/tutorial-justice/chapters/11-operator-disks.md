# 11. Disks: Files Disk and Backup Disk

This chapter is for the school operator, with the IDEA contact on the phone.

## 11.1 A new disk (not yet an IDEA Disk)

1. A new disk appears under the IDEA box with its model and size and an **UNFORMATTED** badge.
   ![Unformatted disk](../screenshots/B2-00.png)
2. Its view shows the model, the size and two buttons: **Make this a Files Disk** and **Erase this disk…**.

## 11.2 Erase a disk

1. Click **Erase this disk…**. The confirmation shows the disk name, model, size and contents, and the red warning "This erases everything on the disk…".
2. Check the **size and contents**: several disks can have the same name (for example **IDEA Disk**). Make sure it is not the Backup Disk.
3. The box above the text field says **TYPE IDEA DISK TO CONFIRM** (the disk name in capitals). Type the name as it is written on the disk, for example `IDEA Disk`. The **Erase this disk** button stays grey until the name is right. Press **Cancel** if anything looks wrong.

4. After the erase, the disk shows as an **IDEA Disk** with the **empty** badge.

> **A Files Disk that Nextcloud is using cannot be erased.** Ask your IDEA contact to stop Nextcloud first.

## 11.3 Make a Files Disk

1. Select the **IDEA Disk** marked **empty**. The view asks "What would you like to do with this disk?": **Make this a Files Disk**, **Make this a Backup Disk** or **Install App**.

2. Click **Make this a Files Disk**. The panel says "Nothing on the disk is erased", with **SHARE NAME** filled in as **School Files**. Click **Make this a Files Disk**.

3. After a short wait the disk shows the **files** badge, "Share name: School Files", the free space, an **Eject** button and **Erase this disk…**. Once your IDEA contact has linked it, the view also says **Available in: Nextcloud**. Teachers then find it in Nextcloud (chapter 8).

## 11.4 Eject a disk

An IDEA Disk has a small eject icon next to its name in the Network list and an **Eject** button in its disk view. The System Disk has none. Never eject or unplug a disk during a backup.

## 11.5 Make a Backup Disk

1. Select an **IDEA Disk** marked **empty** and click **Make this a Backup Disk**.
   ![Empty disk options](../screenshots/B2-10.png)
2. Choose when backups run: **On demand** (only when you press **Back up**), **Immediate** (as soon as the disk is plugged in) or **Scheduled**. Your IDEA contact tells you which.

3. Under **LINK TO INSTANCES**, tick only the school apps to protect: Kolibri and Nextcloud.

4. Click **Configure Backup Disk**. The disk gets the **backup** badge and a **Backups** list with each linked app.

## 11.6 Run a backup

1. In **ALL APPS**, each linked app row has a **Back up** button next to Start, Stop and Open. Click it for Kolibri. The row shows **Backing up…** with a progress bar, and the **OPERATIONS** box at the top shows the same job.

2. The app stops for a short time while it is copied, then starts again. When the job is finished the OPERATIONS box shows **Done**; close it with **✕**. A backup takes a few minutes. Do this outside lesson time.
3. When it is done, the Backup Disk's **Backups** list shows **Last backup** with the date and time for each app. Repeat for Nextcloud.

## 11.7 Restore after a breakdown

You need a **spare disk** (an empty IDEA Disk) to restore onto.

1. Open the **Backup Disk**. Each app in the **Backups** list shows **Last backup**, a **Select target disk…** list and a **Restore** button (grey until a target is chosen).
2. In **Select target disk…** choose the spare disk. Only spare disks are offered here. Click **Restore**.

3. The Console asks: "Are you sure? This will overwrite **kolibri-1.0** on **IDEA Disk**." Click **Confirm Restore**.

4. After about a minute the spare disk shows the **app** badge and lists the restored app.

5. The restore **moves** the app: it is no longer listed on its old disk, and the restored app is **stopped** (orange dot, **Start** button). Until you start it, the app cannot be opened. A restore is for a real breakdown, not for practice on a working school box.
6. Click **Start** on the restored app's row. After about 30 seconds it runs again and the row shows **Open ↗**.

7. Open the app from its card on the **Apps** page (as in Figure 2) and sign in as the teacher (coach).
8. Check that the data is back: classes, learners, lessons, quizzes and reports, as at the last backup.

9. Later, your IDEA contact can move the app back to the System Disk and prepare the spare disk again.

> **Important.** Anything done after the last backup is lost. Make a new backup of the restored app as soon as it runs.
