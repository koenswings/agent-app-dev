# How to use this guide

This guide explains how Justice can use Koen's IDEA demo server, **wizardly-hugle**, from anywhere in the world: from Zimbabwe, from a hotel, or from home. Justice uses it to give demos and to follow the teacher tutorial (`IDEA-teacher-tutorial.pdf`) without being in Belgium.

The guide has two parts:

- **Part A, for Koen** (section 2): share the one machine wizardly-hugle with Justice, and stop the share later.
- **Part B, for Justice** (sections 3 to 8): install Tailscale, accept the share, open the IDEA Console and the apps, and fix common problems.

Each step has:

1. **Do:** what to do.
2. **✔ Check:** how to see that it worked.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**No passwords in this guide.** The passwords for the IDEA Console and for the demo accounts in Kolibri and Nextcloud are **not** written here. Koen sends them to Justice separately (for example in a private message). Keep them private and do not write them on paper that stays at a school.
</div>

<div class="warn" markdown="1">
**wizardly-hugle is also a real working server.** Next to the demo apps it runs **MilkWise**, an app that Koen's family uses every day. Use only the IDEA Console and the demo apps (Kolibri, Nextcloud, Kiwix). **Never open, stop or remove MilkWise**, and never stop or remove any app that you did not install yourself. See section 8.
</div>

# 1. What this is and why

## 1.1 In plain words

wizardly-hugle is a Raspberry Pi in Koen's home in Belgium. It runs the same IDEA software as the school servers that Justice takes to Zimbabwe: the **IDEA Console** and the apps **Kolibri**, **Nextcloud** and **Kiwix** (offline Wikipedia).

wizardly-hugle is **not** open to the public internet. To reach it from far away, we use **Tailscale**. Tailscale is a free app that builds a private, encrypted connection ("tunnel") between devices over the normal internet. Each Tailscale user has their own private network of devices, called a **tailnet**.

- Justice installs Tailscale on his own devices and signs in with **his own** Tailscale account. He gets his own tailnet.
- Koen **shares** only the one machine wizardly-hugle with Justice's account. Justice does **not** join Koen's tailnet and cannot see Koen's other devices.
- After that, Justice opens wizardly-hugle's web pages in a normal web browser, using the address `100.115.60.6`.

## 1.2 The steps at a glance

![The five steps: Justice creates an account and installs Tailscale, sends his email address, Koen shares the machine, Justice accepts the invite and opens the Console](diagrams/flow.svg)

## 1.3 What you need

| ☐ | What | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ☐ | A device with a web browser | Justice's Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu, or a Windows PC, Mac, Android phone or tablet, iPhone or iPad. |
| ☐ | Internet access | Any internet works: Starlink, mobile data, hotel Wi-Fi. |
| ☐ | A Google, Microsoft, Apple or GitHub account | Tailscale has no passwords of its own: you sign in with one of these accounts [3]. |
| ☐ | The passwords from Koen | Sent separately, not in this guide. |

## 1.4 The addresses

| Service | Address to type in the browser |
|---|---|
| IDEA Console | `http://100.115.60.6:8081` |
| Kolibri | `http://100.115.60.6:54189` |
| Nextcloud | `http://100.115.60.6:50065` |
| Kiwix (offline Wikipedia) | `http://100.115.60.6:61312` |

`100.115.60.6` is wizardly-hugle's Tailscale address. The number after the colon (`:8081` and so on) is the **port**: it chooses the app. These addresses only work while Tailscale is running and connected on your device.

<div class="part"><h1 class="parttitle" id="part-a">Part A: For Koen</h1></div>

# 2. Sharing wizardly-hugle with Justice

This part is for Koen. It takes about five minutes. The menu names below are from Tailscale's sharing documentation [1].

## 2.1 Before you start

1. **Do:** Wait for Justice's email with the address of **his** Tailscale account (Part B, section 3.1).
2. **Do:** Sign in to the Tailscale admin console at `https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines` with Koen's account. Only an **Owner**, **Admin** or **IT admin** of the tailnet can share a machine [1].
3. **Do:** Find wizardly-hugle on the **Machines** page. Type `100.115.60.6` in the search box.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Name in Tailscale.** In Koen's Machines list, wizardly-hugle is currently listed under its Tailscale machine name **idea** (full name `idea.tail2d60.ts.net`), with the address `100.115.60.6`. The IDEA Console calls the same box wizardly-hugle. Always check the address `100.115.60.6` before you share, so you share the right machine.
</div>

**✔ Check:** you see one row with the address `100.115.60.6`.

## 2.2 Share the machine

**Option 1: share by email (recommended).** Tailscale sends Justice a single-use invite link [1].

1. **Do:** In the row of wizardly-hugle, select the **...** menu (three dots), then select **Share**. The **Share** dialog opens.
2. **Do:** Select the **Share by email** tab.
3. **Do:** Type Justice's email address.
4. **Do:** Select **Share**.

**Option 2: share with a link.** Use this if the email does not arrive.

1. **Do:** In the row of wizardly-hugle, select the **...** menu, then **Share**.
2. **Do:** Select the **Copy invite link** tab. Leave **Reusable link** switched **off**: the link is then single-use, so only one person can accept it.
3. **Do:** Select **Copy share link**. The link is now on your clipboard.
4. **Do:** Send the link to Justice in a private message (WhatsApp, Signal or email).

<div class="warn" markdown="1">
**Treat the invite link like a password.** Whoever accepts it first can reach wizardly-hugle [1]. Do not post it in a group chat. An unused invite link expires after **30 days** [1].
</div>

**✔ Check:** after Justice has accepted, his picture and email address appear in the **Share** dialog of wizardly-hugle, and the Machines list shows that wizardly-hugle is shared with an external user [1].

Then send Justice the passwords for the IDEA Console and the demo accounts, **separately** (not in the same message as the invite link).

## 2.3 Stop the share later (revoke)

Revoke the share when Justice no longer needs it, or at once if a device of his is lost or stolen.

1. **Do:** Open the **Machines** page of the admin console.
2. **Do:** For wizardly-hugle, select the **...** menu, then **Share**.
3. **Do:** In the **Share** dialog, select the **...** menu next to Justice's invite, then select **Revoke invite** [1].

**✔ Check:** Justice's name is gone from the Share dialog. From now on he cannot reach wizardly-hugle. To give access again, send a new invite; he must accept the new one [1].

If you also want to lock him out of the apps, change the IDEA Console and demo passwords.

## 2.4 Good to know for Koen

- **Justice sees only this one machine.** A shared machine is visible only to the person who accepted it, not to the rest of his tailnet, and not to Koen's other machines [1].
- **Quarantine.** A shared machine can answer connections from Justice, but it **cannot start** connections to Justice's devices [1].
- **Access rules.** Sharing follows the access control policy of Koen's tailnet [1]. If Justice sees wizardly-hugle but no page loads, check that the tailnet policy file allows his email address (or `autogroup:shared`) to reach `100.115.60.6` on ports 8081, 54189, 50065 and 61312 [1].
- **Key expiry.** If wizardly-hugle's Tailscale key expires, nobody can reach it until it signs in again. For an always-on server, Tailscale suggests **Disable key expiry** in the machine's **...** menu on the Machines page [2].
- **Keep the Pi on.** Justice can only use wizardly-hugle while it is powered on and online. Tell him before you switch it off or move it.

<div class="part"><h1 class="parttitle" id="part-b">Part B: For Justice</h1></div>

# 3. Setting up Tailscale on your devices

Do 3.1 once. Then install Tailscale on each device you want to use: 3.2 for your Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu, and 3.3 to 3.6 for other devices. Sign in with **the same account** on every device.

## 3.1 Create your Tailscale account

Tailscale has no passwords of its own. You sign in with an account you already have: **Google** (Gmail), **Microsoft** (Outlook, Hotmail), **Apple** or **GitHub** [3]. The first time you sign in, Tailscale creates your own tailnet. You do this during the install on your first device (3.2, step 5).

- Use a **personal** address such as Gmail or Outlook. With such an address Tailscale puts you on the free **Personal** plan [4].
- If you sign in with a work or school address that has its own domain, Tailscale starts a business trial instead [4]. Avoid this.

**Do:** Send Koen the email address of the account you will use for Tailscale, for example "my Tailscale account is the Gmail address ...". Koen needs it to share wizardly-hugle with you (Part A).

**✔ Check:** Koen has your email address.

## 3.2 Install on Ubuntu (your Raspberry Pi)

These commands come from Tailscale's Linux install guide [2]. They work on Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi. You need internet and the password of your Ubuntu user (for `sudo`).

1. **Do:** Open a terminal: press **Ctrl + Alt + T**.

2. **Do:** Make sure `curl` (a small download tool) is installed:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl
```

**✔ Check:** the last line says `curl` is already the newest version, or that it was installed.

3. **Do:** Install Tailscale with the official install script:

```
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
```

The script asks for your Ubuntu password. Type it and press **Enter** (the password does not show while you type).

**✔ Check:** the script ends without an error message. `tailscale version` now prints a version number.

4. **Do:** Start Tailscale:

```
sudo tailscale up
```

**✔ Check:** the terminal shows `To authenticate, visit:` followed by a web address that starts with `https://login.tailscale.com/`.

5. **Do:** Open that web address in a browser: right-click it and choose **Open Link**, or copy it into the browser. Sign in with the account from 3.1 (for example **Sign in with Google**) and confirm that you want to connect this device. If your Pi has no browser, you can type the address on your phone instead.

**✔ Check:** the terminal prints `Success.` [2].

6. **Do:** Check that your Pi is in your tailnet:

```
tailscale status
tailscale ip -4
```

**✔ Check:** `tailscale status` shows a line with your own Pi and a `100.x.y.z` address. `tailscale ip -4` prints that address [2].

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**After a reboot** Tailscale starts again by itself; you do not need to run `sudo tailscale up` every time. To disconnect for a while, run `sudo tailscale down`; to connect again, run `sudo tailscale up` [5].
</div>

## 3.3 Install on Windows

Tailscale needs Windows 10 or later [6].

1. **Do:** Download the Windows installer (`.exe`) from `https://tailscale.com/download` and run it.
2. **Do:** A Tailscale icon appears in the system tray (bottom right, next to the clock; select the small up arrow if you do not see it). Right-click the icon.
3. **Do:** Select **Log in**. A browser window opens. Sign in with the account from 3.1 [6].

**✔ Check:** right-click the tray icon again: it shows your account and that Tailscale is connected.

## 3.4 Install on macOS

Tailscale needs macOS 12 (Monterey) or later [7].

1. **Do:** Download Tailscale from `https://tailscale.com/download` (or from the Mac App Store) and install it.
2. **Do:** Open Tailscale and follow the steps on screen. Allow the **VPN configuration** when the Mac asks.
3. **Do:** Sign in with the account from 3.1 [7].

**✔ Check:** the Tailscale icon in the menu bar at the top of the screen shows that you are connected.

## 3.5 Install on Android

Tailscale needs Android 8.0 or later [8].

1. **Do:** Install **Tailscale** from the Google Play Store.
2. **Do:** Open the app and tap **Get Started**. Accept the request to add a **VPN configuration** and allow notifications [8].
3. **Do:** Tap **Sign in with Google**, or **Sign in with other** for a Microsoft, Apple or GitHub account [8]. Use the account from 3.1.

**✔ Check:** the app shows that you are connected, and a list of your devices.

## 3.6 Install on iPhone or iPad

Tailscale needs iOS 15 or later [9].

1. **Do:** Install **Tailscale** from the App Store.
2. **Do:** Open the app and tap **Get Started**. Accept the request to add a **VPN configuration** and allow notifications [9].
3. **Do:** Tap **Log in** and sign in with the account from 3.1 [9].

**✔ Check:** the app shows that you are connected and lists your devices.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Phones and tablets allow only one VPN at a time.** If you use another VPN app, switch it off while you use Tailscale.
</div>

# 4. Accepting the share invite

Koen sends you an invite (Part A). It comes as an **email from Tailscale**, or as a **link** in a message from Koen.

1. **Do:** Open the invite link (in the email, or the link Koen sent you) in a web browser.
2. **Do:** If Tailscale asks you to sign in, sign in with **the same account that you use on your devices** (3.1). The invite does not have to match the email address it was sent to: it is added to whichever Tailscale account accepts it [1].
3. **Do:** Read the invitation and accept it.

**✔ Check:** wizardly-hugle now appears in your list of machines: on the **Machines** page of your own admin console (`https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines`) and in the Tailscale app on your devices [1]. It is listed with the address `100.115.60.6` and the name **idea** (the name it has in Koen's tailnet), shown as shared with you.

<div class="warn" markdown="1">
**Each invite works once.** An invite sent by email, or a single-use link, can be accepted only once and expires after 30 days if it is not used [1]. If you accepted it with the wrong account, or it has expired, ask Koen for a new invite.
</div>

# 5. Checking that it works

## 5.1 On your Ubuntu Pi (terminal)

1. **Do:** Run:

```
tailscale status
```

**✔ Check:** there is a line with `100.115.60.6`, the name `idea.tail2d60.ts.net` and Koen's account as the owner [1]. If the line ends in `offline`, wizardly-hugle is switched off or has no internet (see 7.5).

2. **Do:** Test the connection:

```
tailscale ping 100.115.60.6
```

**✔ Check:** you see lines that start with `pong from`. The first ones may say `via DERP(...)`; that is normal while Tailscale looks for the fastest route [10]. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop if it keeps going.

The normal `ping 100.115.60.6` also works; it shows lines with `time=... ms`. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop it.

## 5.2 On a phone, tablet, Windows PC or Mac

1. **Do:** Open the Tailscale app and look at the list of machines.

**✔ Check:** wizardly-hugle (listed as **idea**, address `100.115.60.6`) is in the list. Then go straight to section 6: if the IDEA Console opens, everything works.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
**Use the number `100.115.60.6`.** In rare cases, Tailscale gives a shared machine a different `100.x.y.z` address in your tailnet, because your tailnet already uses that number [1]. If the address shown for wizardly-hugle (idea) in your Tailscale app is not `100.115.60.6`, use the address shown in the app everywhere in this guide, and tell Koen.
</div>

# 6. Opening the IDEA Console and the apps

## 6.1 The IDEA Console

1. **Do:** Make sure Tailscale is connected on your device (section 5).
2. **Do:** Open a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Edge) and type exactly:

```
http://100.115.60.6:8081
```

Type `http://`, not `https://`, and do not forget `:8081`.

3. **Do:** Wait. At the top the Console first says **Connecting…**. After a few seconds (up to half a minute on a slow connection) it connects and the **Apps** page shows one card per app: **Kiwix**, **Kolibri**, **MilkWise** and **Nextcloud**.

**✔ Check:** the page title is **IDEA Console** and the app cards are visible.

4. **Do:** To open an app, click the blue **Open** button on its card. The app opens in a new browser tab, at the `100.115.60.6` address with the app's own port (for example `http://100.115.60.6:54189/...` for Kolibri).

<div class="warn" markdown="1">
**Do not click Open on MilkWise.** Use only the cards **Kiwix**, **Kolibri** and **Nextcloud**. Do not use **Stop**, **Remove**, **Erase** or **Back up** on wizardly-hugle unless Koen has asked you to (section 8).
</div>

If the Console asks for a password, use the one Koen sent you.

## 6.2 Kolibri

1. **Do:** Click **Open** on the **Kolibri** card, or type `http://100.115.60.6:54189`.

**✔ Check:** the Kolibri sign-in page opens (the address ends in `/en/auth/`). Sign in with a demo account; the usernames are in the appendix of the teacher tutorial, the passwords come from Koen.

## 6.3 Nextcloud

1. **Do:** Click **Open** on the **Nextcloud** card, or type `http://100.115.60.6:50065`.

**✔ Check:** the Nextcloud sign-in page opens (the address ends in `/login`). Sign in with a demo account from Koen.

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

## 6.4 Kiwix (offline Wikipedia)

1. **Do:** Click **Open** on the **Kiwix** card, or type `http://100.115.60.6:61312`.

**✔ Check:** the Kiwix library opens and shows the available books, such as Wikipedia. Kiwix needs no password.

## 6.5 Bookmarks

Save these addresses as bookmarks in your browser (press **Ctrl + D**, or **⌘ + D** on a Mac), so you do not need to type them again.

| Bookmark name | Address | Sign in with |
|---|---|---|
| IDEA Console (demo) | `http://100.115.60.6:8081` | Console password from Koen, if asked |
| Kolibri (demo) | `http://100.115.60.6:54189` | Kolibri demo account, e.g. `demo_teacher1` |
| Nextcloud (demo) | `http://100.115.60.6:50065` | Nextcloud demo account, e.g. `demo-teacher1` |
| Kiwix (demo) | `http://100.115.60.6:61312` | No sign-in |

The bookmarks work only while Tailscale is connected on that device.

## 6.6 Following the teacher tutorial remotely

The teacher tutorial (`IDEA-teacher-tutorial.pdf`) was made with screenshots of wizardly-hugle, so what you see matches the tutorial.

- Where the tutorial says "go to the Console address your IDEA contact gives you", use `http://100.115.60.6:8081`.
- The tutorial tells teachers not to type ports and to use **Open** in the Console. That rule is for teachers at school. For you, working remotely, the bookmarks in 6.5 are fine.
- **Part A of the tutorial** (Kolibri, Nextcloud, Wikipedia offline) can be followed on wizardly-hugle with the demo accounts. Use only the demo accounts and demo content (names starting with `demo`).
- **Part B of the tutorial** (Files Disk, Backup Disk, operator tasks) needs USB disks plugged into the server. You cannot do that remotely. On wizardly-hugle, only look at those screens; practise the disk steps on a school server in front of you.

# 7. Troubleshooting

![Check in this order: Tailscale on, signed in, share accepted, server online, right address](diagrams/checks.svg)

## 7.1 Tailscale is not connected or you are logged out

**What you see:** no page opens; the Tailscale app says you are logged out or disconnected; or `tailscale status` prints `Logged out.` or `Tailscale is stopped.` [5].

**What to do:**

1. On Ubuntu, run `sudo tailscale up`. If it shows a web address, open it and sign in again with **your** account (3.2, step 5).
2. On Windows, Mac, Android or iPhone, open the Tailscale app and switch it on, or select **Log in** again.

**✔ Check:** `tailscale status` lists your devices again, or the app shows that you are connected.

## 7.2 wizardly-hugle is not in your machine list

**Possible causes:** the invite was not accepted yet; it was accepted with a different Tailscale account; the invite expired (30 days); or Koen revoked the share.

**What to do:**

1. Check which account is signed in on your device (Tailscale app, or the account column in `tailscale status`). It must be the account that accepted the invite.
2. Open the invite again and accept it (section 4).
3. If the link does not work any more, ask Koen for a new invite.

## 7.3 `tailscale up` says you need sudo

**What you see:** `tailscale up` stops with a permission error and the hint `Use 'sudo tailscale up'.` [5].

**What to do:** type the command again with `sudo` in front: `sudo tailscale up`, and enter your Ubuntu password. Commands that only read, such as `tailscale status` and `tailscale ping`, work without `sudo`.

## 7.4 The page does not load

**What you see:** the browser waits for a long time, or says that the site cannot be reached.

**What to do, in this order:**

1. Is Tailscale connected on **this** device? (7.1)
2. Check the address: `http://` (not `https://`), `100.115.60.6`, a colon, and the right port (`8081`, `54189`, `50065` or `61312`).
3. On a phone: is another VPN app switched on? Switch it off.
4. Test the connection with `tailscale ping 100.115.60.6` (5.1). If you get `pong from`, the connection works; reload the page, or try the Console instead of the app.
5. If the Console stays on **Connecting…** for more than a minute, reload the page (**F5**, or **Ctrl + R**).
6. If the ping works but no page loads at all, tell Koen: he may need to check the access rules (2.4).

## 7.5 wizardly-hugle is switched off, asleep or offline

**What you see:** `tailscale status` shows `offline` on the line of wizardly-hugle (`100.115.60.6`), or `tailscale ping` gets no `pong`; the Tailscale app shows the machine as offline.

**What to do:** there is nothing you can fix from your side. The Pi in Belgium may be switched off, restarting, or Koen's home internet may be down. Send Koen a message and try again later. Remember the time difference: until 25 October 2026 (Belgian summer time) Belgium and Zimbabwe have the same time; after that, Belgium is one hour behind Zimbabwe until the end of March.

## 7.6 Everything is very slow

**Why:** when Tailscale cannot make a direct connection between your device and wizardly-hugle, it sends the traffic through one of its relay servers (called **DERP**). This is common on Starlink, mobile data and hotel Wi-Fi. The connection is still encrypted, but it is slower [10].

**How to see it:** `tailscale status` shows `relay` on the line of wizardly-hugle (for example `relay "ams"`), and `tailscale ping 100.115.60.6` keeps saying `via DERP(...)`. When it says `direct`, or `via` followed by an address, the connection is direct [10].

**What to do:**

1. Wait a minute: Tailscale keeps trying to switch to a direct connection [10].
2. Try another network if you can (for example mobile data instead of hotel Wi-Fi).
3. For demos, prefer light pages (Kiwix articles, Kolibri exercises) over large videos.

# 8. Do's and don'ts, and privacy

## 8.1 Do's and don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Use the IDEA Console, Kolibri, Nextcloud and Kiwix for demos and for the tutorial. | Never open, stop or remove **MilkWise**. It is a real app that Koen's family uses. |
| Use only the demo accounts and demo content (names starting with `demo`). | Never stop or remove an app that you did not install yourself. |
| Ask Koen before you change settings, install an app or use any button that changes the server. | Do not use **Erase**, **Back up** or **Restore** on wizardly-hugle unless Koen asks you to. |
| Keep the passwords from Koen private. | Do not write the passwords in this guide, on a school wall or in a shared chat. |
| Tell Koen at once if a device with Tailscale is lost or stolen, so he can revoke the share. | Do not forward the invite link to anyone else. |
| Switch Tailscale off on a shared or school computer when you are done (`sudo tailscale down` on Ubuntu). | Do not sign in to your Tailscale account on a computer that students use. |

<div style="page-break-before: always"></div>

## 8.2 Privacy: what each side can see

![Justice sees only wizardly-hugle; Koen's other machines stay hidden; wizardly-hugle cannot start connections to Justice's devices](diagrams/privacy.svg)

- **You see only wizardly-hugle.** Koen shares this one machine. You cannot see or reach Koen's other devices [1].
- **wizardly-hugle cannot reach your devices.** A shared machine is quarantined: it can answer your connections, but it cannot start a connection to your devices [1].
- **What Koen sees about you.** When you accept the invite, Koen sees your email address and profile picture, so that he knows who accepted [1].
- **Your own tailnet stays yours.** Your own devices are in your own tailnet. Koen cannot see them or reach them.
- **Koen can stop the share at any time** (Part A, 2.3). If that happens, wizardly-hugle disappears from your list; ask Koen if you need access again.
